I've got my certification in PMP back in 2017, when the PMBOK is at the 5th edition. So recently I had a quick review of the new 6th edition, and here are my accounts of the changes. 

## Changes from 5th edition

Renames:
1. Human Resouce > Resource
2. Perform Quality Assurance > Manage Quality
3. Time Management > Quality Management 
4. Acquire Project Team > Acquire Resources
5. Develop Project Team > Develop Team
6. Manage Project Team > Manage Team
7. Control Stakeholder Engagement > Monitor Stakeholder Engagement

Movements:
1. Estimate Activity Resources moved from Time Management to Resource Management

New Processes:
1. Manage Project Knowledge
2. Control Resources process in Resource Management
3. Implement Risk Responses in Risk Management

Removed Process:
1. Close Procurements in Procurement Management
