# 1. It doesn't reflect the real world programming experience

This can't be more straightforward. When is the last time anyone need to solve a secondary school mathematics problem sum in real working life? That's what most of the coding assessment platforms are trying to get candidates do. 

# 2. It doesn't test candidates knowledge on code quality environment

When it comes to real-love programming, it is not just if the code works, but more importantly is the quality, that can mean there should be enough testing, and whether the tests are sufficient and reflects the real-life possibilities. These couldn't be tested in the little tricky coding tests. I have came across quite a few pointless test cases that demonstrate nothing but blindly following guidelines on what is needed. 

# 3. There isn't time to demonstrate proper thinking

Setting time limits just forces candidates to go by the easiest and fastest way out, and that is an antithesis of producing well-rounded code. There are many future aspects to consider when writing code, and that's why we have the four-eye principle, so that we can reduce the chances of having a careless mistake resulting in huge nightmares. Unless your company's application are so bad that requires constant fire-fighting, there shouldn't be a requirement to code under pressure.

# 4. Programming theories that can be easily googled

There are some platforms I came across that just ask simple programming theories. Theories are good foundations, but one doesn't need to remember the name of the terms to understand that. In fact, most of the time, these theories got forgotten in classes but the importance to recognize them and use them practically is picked up after gaining experience. One might not remember the name, but practise it strictly. Then, it comes the obvious question of what's stopping anyone from simply googling for an answer?

# 5. It doesn't reflect real world problem solving skill

A lot of time, googling for an answer, understand the usage and able to apply it is how we get things done. There are so many frameworks and languages, there is not a chance one can remember all the implementation details. I, for one, had to google how to use the for loop every time I start on another language I used to use often. What's more important as a developer is the ability to learn and adapt, and use the tools available. The javascript I learnt in school is now totally different from what it is now. New languages, frameworks, platforms are coming out and taking over the domain every few years, one's years of experience shouldn't be a criteria anymore. So the real world problem solving skill for developers include the ability to learn totally new things and do things in new ways. I might not be sure what is the best way to test a candidate's ability to learn, but a coding assessment is definitely not one.
