I am a full stack software engineer and business analyst, based in Singapore. I have been coding for more than 10 years, and that has been my favourite thing to do and learn ever since. More than just programming, I am more interested in how my applications fit into the work of the users, how it impacts and benefits them, and how it can profit the sponsors. I am an advocate for process simplification and documentation, and I am always looking for better ways to do things and communicate my ideas better.
